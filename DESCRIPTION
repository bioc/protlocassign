Description: This package fits a constrained proportional assignment (cpa)
   model to mass spectrometry data 
    to proportionally assign proteins to subcellular locations.
    The package includes transformations to 
    improve the accuracy of the assignments as well as
    facilities for simulating mixtures and evaluating 
    the perfomance of cpa on those mixtures.
    Also included are facilities for summarizing spectral-level 
    data using random effects models to calculate average protein profiles.
